==========

This package provides a port for [php.js](http://phpjs.org) to Node.js.


## Looking for a new maintainer.  
### Took this project on and just haven't had the time to maintain it.  Contact me if you are interested.

### Install
`npm install phpjs`

### Usage
Is as simple as require it:

    phpjs = require('phpjs');
    console.log(phpjs.ucfirst('hello world!'));
    // Will output: Hello world!

You can register those functions globally too:

    phpjs = require('phpjs').registerGlobals();
    ucfirst('hello world!');
    // Will output: Hello world!
